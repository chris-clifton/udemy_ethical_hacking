# Scanning
- Scanning performed on a much deeper level
- Mainly focused on technology
- Not allowed to do this on just any target that we want

# Goals
- Open ports which it uses to host its software and communicate with other machines on its network
- What software is running on those open ports and what version of the software is running

## Common Ports
- 80 : http
- 443 : https
- 21 : ftp
- 22 : ssh
- 53 : dns
- 25 : smtp

- Every machine has over 65k ports
- But if there is just one port open with vulnerable software running on it, that machine is vulnerable
