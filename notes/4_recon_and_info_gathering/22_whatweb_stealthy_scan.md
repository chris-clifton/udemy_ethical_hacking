# Whatweb Stealthy Scan

## What is whatweb?
- Recognizes web technologies, CMS, blogging platforms, statistic/analytics packages, JS libraries, web servers, and embedded devices
- Identifies version numbers, email addresses, account IDs, web framework modules, SQL errors, and more

## Settings
- The 'stealthy' default aggression level can be used on any website we want
- The more aggressive levels were developed for penetration testing and should not be used
- Look at full list of options with `whatweb` and `whatweb --help`

## Use
`whatweb <website>`
`whatweb -v <website>` is the same thing, just better output
