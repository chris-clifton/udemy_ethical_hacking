# What is Information Gathering?
- The act of gathering information about our target
- Two types: active and passive

## Active Information Gathering
- Use our machine to try to get as much data/info about our target while interacting with them
  - target website we need to test
  - target network we are testing
  - an entire company
- The point is, we get the data we need directly from the target
  - Interacting with the website
  - Communicating with an employee (also considered social engineering)

## Passive Information Gathering
- Use an intermediate system/middle source to get data about our target without having to interact directly with it

## What are the goals?
- IP address/addresses
- Technologies the target has/is running
  - OS
  - Systems running
  - Programming languages/how a website is built
