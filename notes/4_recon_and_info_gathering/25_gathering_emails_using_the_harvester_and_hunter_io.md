# 25: Gathering Emails Using theHarvester and Hunter.io

## theHarvester
- Gets emails from a domain

### Usage
`theHarvester -d <website> -b <source>`
  - Sources can be listed with `theHarvester --help`, but you can just use `all` as well

## hunter.io
- There is a free setting, but not super helpful
- The paid one is expensive and not really worth it
